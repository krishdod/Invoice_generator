## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

1. **Install Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Google Drive API Setup**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the Google Drive API
   - Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client IDs)

   - Place `credentials.json` in the `backend/` folder

3. **Start the Backend Server**

   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

1. **Open the Frontend**
   - Open `frontend/JCF_Invoice_App.html` in a web browser
   - Ensure the backend server is running first

### 3. First-Time Google Drive Authorization

1. When you first upload a PDF, the system will open a browser window
2. Sign in to your Google account
3. Grant permissions to access Google Drive
4. The authorization will be saved for future use
